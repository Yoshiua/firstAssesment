// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition 
    of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This step refers to the systematic process of thoroughly examining and understanding the specifications, expectations, and constraints of a software project. "
const design = "This step refers to the process of creating a structured plan or blueprint for how a software system or application will be built."
const implementation = " This step is the phase of the development process where the actual code is written and the software is built according to the design and specifications created during earlier stages."
const testingAndIntegration ="This step is the process of systematically executing the software to identify defects, errors, and issues, aswell as verifying that different components or modules of the software work together as intended "
const maintain =" refers to the ongoing process of managing, updating, and enhancing a software application or system after it has been deployed or released."
